The triggering team child gains a +1 circumstance bonus on their check, changing the result from a critical failure to a failure or from a failure to a success. However, your focus on your team child distracts you from your own challenges. You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 1}.</p>",
