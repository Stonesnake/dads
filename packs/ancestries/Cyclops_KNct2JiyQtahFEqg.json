As all must do, these mighty nations collapsed over time, and many cyclopes returned to a simpler lifestyle. However, not all cyclopes are ferocious monsters bent on terrorizing and sometimes slaying travelers. In many hidden valleys and distant islands, cyclops settlements have survived. Now the inhabitants of these places—some blessed (or some might say, cursed) with prophetic visions—journey forth to make their way in the wider world.</p>"
