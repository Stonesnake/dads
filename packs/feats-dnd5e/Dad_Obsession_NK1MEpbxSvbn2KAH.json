You are proficient in a set of tools other than thieves’ tools associated with your obsession, for instance, gardening tools for a gardening obsession. Whether they care about your obsession or not, your team children can’t help but learn a bit about it through osmosis. All of your team children can add half their proficiency bonus, rounded down with that tool if they wouldn’t already be including their proficiency bonus.</p>",
