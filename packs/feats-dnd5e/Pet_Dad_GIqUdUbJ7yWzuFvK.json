      "value": "<p>You’re convinced that your pet animal can understand your parental bond in a similar way to a sapient creature. While your acquaintances might be skeptical, you’ve proven it beyond a shadow of a doubt. You can choose nonsapient creatures as team children. You gain the Beast Master’s Primal Companion feature, with the following adjustments: You add the beast as a team child without counting against your usual limit of five team children. The beast is a real creature, rather than a magical one. It doesn’t vanish if you die, you can’t return it to life, and you can’t switch it out for a new one every Long Rest. Instead, you treat it as a member of your own family and mourn its death like you would a child. When you and the GM agree you’re ready to move on, you can choose a new beast. If you eventually decide you’ll never move on, you can instead change to one of the other dad types after your mourning period.</p>",
