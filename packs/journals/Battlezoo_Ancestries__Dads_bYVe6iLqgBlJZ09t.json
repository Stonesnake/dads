        "content": "<p></p><p class=\"subhead\"><em>The dad archetype and subclass was born from a conversation between Roll for Combat and Dungeon Dad: Given that we at Roll for Combat had managed to create a dungeon ancestry, surely it would be possible to create a playable archetype or subclass for a dad as well. That way, you could literally play a dungeon dad. We took that challenge and ran with it, and so for this Father’s Day, we present this free product! For all those dads and dads at heart, or simply those wishing to roleplay as one, while the abilities might be humorous, they will seriously work in your game!</em></p><p>Whether literally the father of one or more of their allies or more of a “team dad” who fulfills that role due to demeanor rather than familial relations, a dad leads the rest of their party by example and teaches them valuable lessons. Or at least they try their best. Some dads are strict and gruff disciplinarians, while others are calm and wise, and still others are goofy and a bit bumbling but well-meaning. It doesn’t matter how they choose to act as the dad for their team; what’s important is that they see this as their role, and they’re trying their best.</p><p>Some team dads try to turn their group’s failures and setbacks into teachable moments they can use to learn. This might seem harsh in the moment, and almost like they’re dwelling on every little mistake, but it comes from a place of genuine desire to see their literal or figurative children grow. Most team dads also try to point out when a party member went above and beyond or did a great job, to maintain balance and keep up motivation, but some gruffer dads can get tongue-tied or embarrassed when it comes to doling out praise.</p><p>Team dads often engage in activities typical of father figures in their cultures. For the purpose of this archetype, this includes concepts and ideas associated with fathers in our world, but if a dad wouldn’t barbecue or tell dad jokes in your world, or the particular country or culture where you set your campaign, feel free to curate the available options to include those that make sense, potentially adding feats specific to your world’s social structures.</p><p>While the role of a team dad is strongly associated with the concept of fatherhood, many fantasy ancestries exist with vastly different life cycles and biologies than humans. For instance, mimics reproduce asexually via spores and don’t tend to interact with their offspring. But that doesn’t stop them from becoming the team dad when that’s the role they’ve come to fill in the group. Even an intelligent dungeon could be a dad, perhaps seeing the various traps and creatures inhabiting their extradimensional dungeon as a sort of unruly children. Indeed, characters of all genders and ages can be a team dad, although they’re most likely to be adult men from ancestries with cultures similar to humans.</p><h2>Dad Archetype</h2><p>The following archetype feats are available to those who wish to take on the role of “dad.”</p><h3>Dad Dedication <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-dads.feats.Item.0HLvpPQxEjsOh1x5]{Dad Dedication}</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-dads.feats.Item.0HLvpPQxEjsOh1x5 inline]</p><h3>Dad Joke <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-dads.feats.Item.dDrSli87QWwlzlbN]{Dad Joke}</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-dads.feats.Item.dDrSli87QWwlzlbN inline]</p><h3>Dad Obsession <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-dads.feats.Item.4aXbEJo1ud3panEB]{Dad Obsession}</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-dads.feats.Item.4aXbEJo1ud3panEB inline]</p><h3>OMGWTFBBQ <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-dads.feats.Item.ko1ohyS36hKuuH1t]{OMGWTFBBQ}</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-dads.feats.Item.ko1ohyS36hKuuH1t inline]</p><h3>Pet Dad <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-dads.feats.Item.5ToREIWE0Mh4OB53]{Pet Dad}</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-dads.feats.Item.5ToREIWE0Mh4OB53 inline]</p><h3>Sports Dad <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-dads.feats.Item.WmODGjEKFXFllZsu]{Sports Dad}</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-dads.feats.Item.WmODGjEKFXFllZsu inline]</p>"
